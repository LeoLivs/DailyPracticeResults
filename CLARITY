#lets switch this up a lil
'''OBJ:i want to ask the user what type of insulation they're using in what situation.would that be conditional?
example: are you using the r13s for walls or ceilings then indicate the answer and keep the r13 numbers
seperate from the rest. '''
'''
What type of statement does that require?
conditional, transfer or iterative?
Conditional: alwys evaluateto euther TRUE OR FALSE [IF/IF-ELSE/IF-ELIF-ELSE/NESTED IF-ELSE]
Transfer: Used to alter the programs way of executionin a certain manner[BREAK/CONTINUE/PASS]
iterative: allows us to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as the condition is TRUE. [FOR/WHILE LOOP]
