''' on Github mobile app and dont know how to create a brwnch or add new code
just thought to mysel, " try to create a branch meatballðŸ™„ðŸ™„)

heres todays(11/23/22) code more nested loops. '''

rows = 5

for r in range(1, rows +1):
  for s in range(1, 4):
    print('*', end ="")
  print('') 

#coulda made it easier for myself by adding range(5) and range(3) according to the solution on pynative.com/nestedloops
