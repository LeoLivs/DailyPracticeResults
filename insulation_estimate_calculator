#Objective: To create an insulation calculator according the sq ft of certain insulation
# define the variables that will be used in the calculator
# create input statements and ask the user for sq ft of walls,ceilings and wide ceilings. 
#divide the user input by the insulation sq ft; r21 r38 and r3822(The wide 38s are a lil larger)
# Using F Strings print the toal bags needed for ceilings, walls and wide ceilings

print("Welcome to the Insulation Estimate Calculator!")
walls = float(input("Whats the sq ft of the walls?"))
ceilings = float(input("Whats the sq ft of the ceiling?"))
wideCeilings = float(input("Whats the sq ft of the wide ceiling"))
#Is an if statement the right function to use here? I want to compare the user input(str) to the 2 options that im giving the user.
#lets switch this up a lil bit
r21 = 67.81
r3815 = 42.67
r3822 = 64
wSqft = walls/r21
cSqft = ceilings/r3815
widecSqft = wideCeilings/r3822
print(f"You're total bags needed for walls is {wSqft}.")
print(f"You're total bags needed for Ceilings is {cSqft}.")
print(f"You're total bags needed for WIDE Ceilings is {widecSqft}.")
